# msc-project
 
Contains my MSc Mathematics project write up and presentation. We studied a type of deep learning model - Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), starting with a basic Machine Learning algorithm - Logistic Regression,
moving on to building blocks of Neural Networks and method of training and optimising neural
network models. We then implemented three different CNN architectures; a base model,
VGG16 and ResNext-50, to classify different plant diseases using healthy and diseased leaf
images. The best performing model was ResNext-50 with 98% accuracy.
